# clean-quick-start

Welcome to your very own Domino quick-start project!

This project has examples for running batch files, iterating using workspaces, publishing models as APIs, and publishing Python/Flask and R/Shiny web applications.

Before you get started, you might want to check out our product tour video.

Run Batch Files
Domino makes it easy to run a file written in your language of choice. By default, it will run on the default hardware tier but this can be easily changed from the "Settings" link on the left.

In the main.* files, you will find code samples in Python and R to write to stdout, chart a histogram with random numbers, and write key run statistics to dominostats.json.

Try running one of these files twice and use the compare run functionality to see how the output, charts, and key statistics changed!

Iterate with Workspaces
Interactive tools like Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio are a popular way to do and share quantitative research.

Domino lets you spin up a workspace server with the click of a button at the "Workspaces" page of a project.

main.ipynb is a sample Jupyter notebook with code similar to main.py. Take note how the notebook lets you intermingle Markdown, input, and output code all in one document. When browsing files from the "Files" page, Domino will render your notebook as you'd expect and you can even schedule your notebook to run and email you using scheduled runs.

Publish a Model as an API
Domino makes it easy to publish your R or Python model as a web service too.

model.py and model.R have my_model functions. By simply specifying the file and function name on the "Publish" page, you can have a REST API for your model set up in no time.

Publish an App
You can also use Domino to deploy a web app to publish dashboards and enable broader data and information sharing.

app.R is an interactive R/Shiny example, app-flask.py is a Python/Flask example, and app-dash.py is a Python/Dash example of this functionality.

app.sh is where you tell Domino which file contains your web app. App publishing is done from the "Publish" page of your project.

Knowledge Management and Sharing
Right now, you're reading the README.md file which is a great place to explain what your project is all about. We suggest every project have a README file -- it helps others onboard onto your project quickly and helps you remember what the point of your project was in the first place :)

README files get shown on a project's overview page and, like all files, get automatically versioned for your convenience and time traveling needs. You can even embed images from the web or your project, for example benefits.png:
